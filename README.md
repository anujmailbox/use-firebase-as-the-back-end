# [Use Firebase as the Back-End][published url]
## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


Firebase is a technology that allows us to create web apps without any server-side programming, so that development becomes quicker and easier. With Firebase, we don't need to worry about provisioning servers or building REST APIsâ€”with just a a little bit of configuration, we can let Firebase do the work: storing data, authenticating users, and enforcing access rules.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will teach you how to use Firebase as a code-free back-end for your apps. You'll see how to use all the most important Firebase functionality from vanilla JavaScript by building a simple product catalog application. You'll also see how easy it is to integrate Firebase with your Angular app using the AngularFire library.


## Source Files Description
